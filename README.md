# 🏗️ Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project** repository! 🚀  
This portfolio project showcases a complete **data warehousing and analytics solution** — from raw data ingestion to generating actionable business insights.  
It demonstrates **industry-standard practices** in **data engineering, modeling, and analytics**.

---

## 🧱 Data Architecture

This project follows the **Medallion Architecture** pattern — **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers — to ensure scalability, reliability, and clarity in data flow.

![Data Architecture](docs/data_architecture.png)

1. **Bronze Layer** – Ingests raw data as-is from source systems (ERP & CRM) into SQL Server.  
2. **Silver Layer** – Cleans, standardizes, and transforms data to ensure consistency and quality.  
3. **Gold Layer** – Stores business-ready, modeled data in a **star schema** optimized for analytics.
